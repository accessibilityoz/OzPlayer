    /*** IMPORTANT NOTE ********************************************************

    this script makes use of pre-processing statements, eg:

        //### PHP ###// <?php if(isset($_GET['foo'])): ?>

        ... javascript code ...

        //### PHP ###// <?php endif; ?>

    when the script is parsed by the compressor, those statements are evaluated,
    so that different versions of the output can be defined via input parameters
    (eg. in that example, using query values to determine different code forks)
    while the leading comment marker ensures that the code is still valid JS
    though obviously running the code as JS won't parse any of the conditions
    so we need to consider how the code will be interpreted when it's pure JS
    eg. if we have two different version of a function declaration, then the
    second one will take precedence, so it must be treated as the default

        //such as native implementations that don't fire enough waiting/canplay events (eg. IE9-11)
        //and for low-bandwidth situations where the video might freeze while loading data
        //even though checking the buffer shows that the time is inside a loaded range
        //and there are two different ways a browser might respond: either continuing to fire
        //timeupdate events with the same currentTime, or not firing timeupdate events while frozen,
        //and this difference in behaviour determines which event we have to use for monitoring:
        //=> progress is used for those that freeze without firing timeupdate (chrome, opera)
        //=> timeupdate is used for those that keep firing same-time timeupdate (IE, firefox flash)
        //   (and with flash we can't rely on the existence of progress events anyway)
        //=> safari is really weird, jumping in a kind of loop when video freezes, eg. going from
        //   25 to 26 to 27 back to 25, and so on for as long as the freeze state persists
        //   and using timeupdate for this sometimes appeared to lock that into an unescapable cycle
        //   not really sure what's going on there, but using progress works better and feels safer
        //   though it still doesn't exactly work brilliantly in safari, it's better than nothing
        //=> ipad safari just pauses if it doesn't have enough bandwidth! and I don't think there's
        //   anything I can do to fix that, but the rest of the time it seems better with progress
        //   though since ios doesn't have audio descriptions its loading indication isn't as important
        //   however all browsers need it with youtube because it doesn't fire reliable progress events
        //   but youtube doesn't have the same freeze problem as we get with standard native video
        //   because it manages most of the buffering and bandwidth negotiation within the api itself
        //however, we can't rely on progress events in native/firefox < 35 because the timerange data
        //they provide is often badly wrong, eg. in Firefox 10 the first time range could be
        //something like [18446744073.71,0.3] while in Firefox 34 it could be [-3000,-2999.53]
        //in the former case, seeking forward will create additional accurate time ranges
        //but in the latter case, seeking forward won't create any more ranges, it will simply
        //keep firing progress events with the first range, even though it obviously does keep
        //loading new data, since playback works fine and seek waiting/canplay combinations do fire
        //and this would mean that the loading indicator continues to show until playback is paused
        //but since waiting/canplay are reliable in firefox we can rely on them for the loading indicator
        //since they fire in all cases of loading, including those cases where playback is frozen
        //(although of course we won't get accurate buffer info in the controls in those older firefox)
        //there's a similar problem in native/youtube with firefox < 35 except that we don't get
        //canplay/waiting events either, so we just have to make do without the custom loading indicator
        //and rely on the fact that youtube's API provides its own loading indication when necessary
