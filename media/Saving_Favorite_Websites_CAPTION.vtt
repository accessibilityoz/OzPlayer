00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.750
<v Douglas>Hello, my name is Douglas Walker.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.820
Today, we are going to be looking at

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.830
setting bookmarks in Safari.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.330
Now, you might be asking what is a bookmark.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.360
Well, bookmarking is a way of making

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.930
or creating a favorite to our website

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.030
so that we can easily access it at a later time.

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.510
It's sort of like creating a list

9
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.240
of all of our favorite webpages,

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.360
and it's a really great way of

11
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.800
being able to keep organized there.

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.710
Now we're also going to look at how to create folders,

13
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.890
and this is great because we can actually save

14
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.833
different types of websites into our different folders.

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.140
First, we're gonna learn how to create a folder,

16
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.530
and then we'll learn how to place our bookmarks

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.540
in a folder.

18
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.540
Now, Safari of course is Apple's web browsing software,

19
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.400
and we happen to have Safari right here on our dock,

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.660
so how about we go ahead and just flick to our Safari app?

21
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.410
So we'll just flick here.

22
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Narrator>Safar.</v>

23
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.973
Double tap to open.

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Douglas>Okay, so, then we'll just</v>

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.330
single finger double tap to launch Safari here.

26
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.523
We'll launch Safari.

27
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Narrator>Safar, skip to content in page link.</v>

28
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.273
<v Douglas>Okay, this is great.</v>

29
00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:25.190
Safari has opened,

30
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.560
and we have been placed right back in the website

31
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.900
that we last had open,

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.660
and it just so happens to be our videos at Hadley page.

33
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.690
Now, this of course is where we will find

34
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.200
all of our iFocus Instructional Videos,

35
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.750
and of course the web address to this

36
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.750
is www.hadley.edu/instructionalvideos.

37
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.950
Alright, so, we're gonna learn how to bookmark

38
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.780
this page page today.

39
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.640
But first, we're gonna take a look

40
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.240
at our Safari interface here.

41
00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:05.617
So we're just we're just gonna explore

42
00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:08.370
how our interface is laid out here.

43
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, we're assuming that we already know

44
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.490
how to browse the internet using Safari.

45
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.850
So, we're just gonna explore a toolbar today.

46
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.840
Now, our toolbar is actually laid out

47
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840
across the bottom edge of our screen

48
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.030
where we typically find tabs laid out.

49
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.540
Now, we actually have five different items

50
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.710
down in our toolbar.

51
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.110
So, we're just gonna go ahead

52
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.170
and touch in the bottom left corner of our screen

53
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.660
to sorta orient ourself to our toolbar.

54
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.871
So, we'll just begin by just touching here in our toolbar

55
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:42.704
down here at the bottom left.

56
00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Narrator>Back button.</v>

57
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.143
Double tap and hold to open history.

58
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.183
<v Douglas>Okay.</v>

59
00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:52.163
So here is our Back button in our bottom-left corner here.

60
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.310
And single finger double tapping on this back button

61
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.140
will take us back to the previous webpage

62
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.070
that we were viewing.

63
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.000
And as we heard voiceover give us some hints there,

64
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.070
we can actually actually double tap and hold

65
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.140
on the second tap while we're on this Back button,

66
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.230
and it will actually open a pop-up dialog for us,

67
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.180
and it'll show us our recent history there.

68
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.230
So that's really nice.

69
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.930
Of course our recent history

70
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.350
is gonna give us the ability to quickly just

71
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.760
jump back a little further in our webpages,

72
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.090
rather than just jumping back one page there.

73
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.000
So, this is a really handy feature for us to have.

74
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.950
Okay, so let's just right flick to our next tool here,

75
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.740
and we'll just go ahead and just right flick here.

76
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.701
So we'll just flick.

77
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.101
<v Narrator>Forward button.</v>

78
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.450
<v Douglas>Okay, so here is our Forward button.</v>

79
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.463
Now, our Forward button is dimmed at the moment,

80
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.740
and this is because we haven't visited a page yet.

81
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.480
And of course we would've had to visit that page

82
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.050
and then move back from it

83
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.140
in order for this not to be dimmed.

84
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.580
However, this Forward button can be really, really handy

85
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.920
if we've visited a website

86
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.490
and we've sort of moved away from it

87
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.540
and then we wanna go back to it.

88
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.190
So that's pretty handy there.

89
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.850
So let's go ahead and right flick.

90
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.100
We're just exploring these on our toolbar here for now.

91
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.430
So we'll go ahead and right flick.

92
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Narrator>Share button.</v>

93
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Douglas>Okay, so this is our share button.</v>

94
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.900
And we're actually going to come back

95
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.550
to our share button in just a bit,

96
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.933
because this is where we're actually gonna set our bookmark.

97
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.490
But first, let's go ahead and just explore

98
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.230
the rest of our bookmarks here.

99
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.320
So, we'll go ahead and just right flick,

100
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.940
and we'll right flick.

101
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Narrator>Show bookmarks button.</v>

102
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Douglas>Okay.</v>

103
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.350
So here is our bookmarks button,

104
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.440
and this is where we're gonna find

105
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.300
all of our saved bookmarks

106
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.250
or all of the bookmarks that we've set.

107
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.970
Okay, and we'll come back here as well

108
00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.803
in just a bit.

109
00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:01.470
So let's right flick first,

110
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.500
and we'll right flick.

111
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Narrator>Pages button.</v>

112
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Douglas>Yeah, and here's our pages button.</v>

113
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.950
Now, Safari gives us the ability

114
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.060
to have several websites or webpages running at one time.

115
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.200
And if we activate our Pages button,

116
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.270
we'll be presented with a list

117
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.050
of all of our open webpages that we have.

118
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.490
And we can quickly move to or switch between

119
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.600
any of our open websites, and that's pretty nice.

120
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.190
Okay, so how about we go ahead,

121
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.850
and we will flick back to our Bookmarks tool,

122
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.850
and we'll check out how to move to our Bookmarks interface.

123
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.850
So, let's go ahead and just left flick.

124
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.690
We'll flick back to bookmarks.

125
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Narrator>Show Bookmarks button.</v>

126
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.170
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's our show bookmarks tool again.</v>

127
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.900
So, we're gonna go ahead and just

128
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.500
single finger double tap

129
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.290
to open our Show Bookmarks interface.

130
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.490
So we'll just single finger double tap here.

131
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Narrator>Favorites Bookmarks, Back button.</v>

132
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Douglas>Okay, so our Bookmarks interface</v>

133
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.980
has opened for us,

134
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.200
and we have been placed on our Bookmarks Favorite,

135
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.480
our Bookmarks Back button

136
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.850
in the top-left corner of our screen here.

137
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.220
Okay, so we're currently in our Bookmarks screen of course.

138
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.210
Now what we have here is actually a list

139
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.880
of all of our folders that we have created.

140
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.500
And these folders are of course where we will save

141
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.093
all of our bookmarks, all of our bookmarked websites.

142
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.350
Alright, so how about we quickly just

143
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.920
move through this Bookmarks interface here,

144
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.490
and we'll check out first how to add a new folder

145
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.520
to this folders list.

146
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.310
So let's go ahead and just right flick from here,

147
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.280
and we'll right flick.

148
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Narrator>Favorites, heading.</v>

149
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Douglas>Great, so here of course</v>

150
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.123
is our Favorites heading.

151
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.070
It's in the top center of our screen

152
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.270
and just below our time and our status bar there.

153
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.780
So let's go ahead and just right flick,

154
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.110
and we'll right flick.

155
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.360
<v Narrator>Done button.</v>

156
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.720
<v Douglas>Yeah, here we have a Done button</v>

157
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.050
in the top-right hand corner of our screen.

158
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.450
So if we decide we don't wanna interact

159
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.050
with this Bookmarks interface,

160
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.960
we can just activate this Done button here to close it,

161
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.820
and we would be place right back

162
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.670
in our iFocus Instructional Videos website there.

163
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.010
However, we don't wanna close this,

164
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.650
so we'll just right flick from here,

165
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.260
and we'll go ahead and right flick.

166
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.933
<v Narrator>Selected bookmarks button, one of three.</v>

167
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.520
<v Douglas>Okay, so we have three buttons here</v>

168
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.970
that run across the top of our Bookmarks interface here,

169
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.540
and they are just below the heading here.

170
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.000
Now, we heard voiceover announce

171
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.830
that our bookmarks are selected.

172
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.930
So we know for sure that all of our bookmarks

173
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.143
are currently visible in our below list here.

174
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.590
Okay, so let's just right flick

175
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.898
to the second of these three buttons here

176
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.540
and check them out.

177
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.350
So we just right flick here.

178
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.593
<v Narrator>Reading List button, two of three.</v>

179
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Douglas>Okay, so here is our Reading List button.</v>

180
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.870
Now we have the ability to save articles if we like

181
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.000
for later reading.

182
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.700
And if we activate our Reading List button here,

183
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.450
all of our saved articles will be listed on this screen,

184
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.850
instead of our bookmarks,

185
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.980
and that's a pretty nice feature.

186
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.030
So let's go ahead and right flick here.

187
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.060
So we'll go ahead and just right flick.

188
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.170
<v Narrator>Social Links button, three of three.</v>

189
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.003
<v Douglas>This is cool.</v>

190
00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:36.570
This is our Social Links button.

191
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.280
And this is where we'll find all of our feeds

192
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.420
from social apps,

193
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.370
such as maybe twitter or even Facebook.

194
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.203
So we have a lot more than just our bookmarks here.

195
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.380
Now, if we right flick again,

196
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.070
we will be placed right in our Bookmarks Folders list.

197
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.650
So let's go ahead and just right flick

198
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.730
and check it out here.

199
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.700
So we'll right flick.

200
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.730
<v Narrator>Blindness Information folder button.</v>

201
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.060
Actions available.

202
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.950
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's our</v>

203
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.470
Blindness Information folder,

204
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.430
and this is one that I created

205
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.150
to explore or store any websites

206
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.520
that happen to be kinda blindness information specific

207
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.190
or blindness related.

208
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.420
And if we were to single finger double tap on this folder,

209
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.660
we would be presented with a list

210
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.230
of all of our websites that we've saved to this folder,

211
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.330
which is pretty great.

212
00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:36.913
Alright, now we have several folders here in this list,

213
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.720
and we could just continue

214
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.460
to right flick through this list if we wanted to.

215
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.750
However, how about we go ahead and just create a new folder?

216
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.000
And since we want

217
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.053
to bookmark our iFocus Instructional Videos website,

218
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.570
how about we create a Hadley folder for that?

219
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.920
And that way we can also save

220
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.000
any of our other Hadley-related website there as well.

221
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.630
Now, we have an Edit button

222
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.170
right here on the bottom-right hand corner of our screen.

223
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.693
And to make our new folder button visible,

224
00:10:14.952 --> 00:10:16.660
we'll need to activate this Edit button.

225
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.070
So let's go ahead and touch our Edit button.

226
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.500
We'll just go ahead and touch it

227
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.180
in the bottom-right hand corner here.

228
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.110
So we'll just touch.

229
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.560
<v Narrator>Short cuts and command, Edit button.</v>

230
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.950
<v Douglas>Okay, so there of course is our Edit button,</v>

231
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.510
and it's now active or the focus is now on it.

232
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.280
So we'll just single finger double tap now

233
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.580
to activate it.

234
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.080
So we'll go ahead and just single finger

235
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.140
double tap anywhere here.

236
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Narrator>Edit, Done button.</v>

237
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.780
<v Douglas>Okay, so you heart our Edit button</v>

238
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.840
turn into a Done button now.

239
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.650
So we'll just come back here

240
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.060
when we're done creating our new folder

241
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.560
and activate this done button.

242
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.040
Okay, so we now have a new folder button,

243
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.970
and it's visible down here

244
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.483
on the bottom left-hand corner of our screen.

245
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.740
So let's go ahead and just touch

246
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.420
this New Folder button in the bottom-left corner here.

247
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.050
So we'll go ahead and touch it down here.

248
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.600
<v Narrator>New Folder button.</v>

249
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Douglas>Okay, so there is the New Folder button.</v>

250
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.933
Now, if we activate our New Folder button,

251
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.610
this is gonna open our New Folder interface,

252
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.700
and we'll be placed right in an edit field

253
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.200
for creating or naming our new folder.

254
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.730
So let's go ahead and single finger double tap,

255
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.610
and we'll begin creating our new folder here.

256
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.423
So we'll just single finger double tap anywhere now.

257
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.840
<v Narrator>Title, text field.</v>

258
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.013
Doublet tap to edit.

259
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.283
<v Douglas>Great.</v>

260
00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:44.450
And like we said, we have been placed

261
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.950
right in our edit field for naming our folder.

262
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.950
So, how about we go ahead and just name this folder Hadley?

263
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.530
Now, we've been presented with a standard qwerty keyboard

264
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.130
down here at the bottom of our screen.

265
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.250
So, we'll just go ahead and type Hadley.

266
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.380
And we'll type Hadley here.

267
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.403
<v Narrator>Cap G, cap H, cap H, Shift,</v>

268
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.660
a, a,

269
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.080
d, d, k,

270
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.310
l, l,

271
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.760
r, e, e,

272
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.883
y, y.

273
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.480
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's our new folder's name.</v>

274
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.480
So, to create it, all we need to do

275
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.910
is activate our Done button

276
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.140
in the bottom-right hand corner of our keyboard here.

277
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.820
So, let's go touch our Done button down here

278
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.280
in the bottom right corner.

279
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.010
<v Narrator>Done.</v>

280
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Douglas>And there it is.</v>

281
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.230
So, all we need to do is just single finger double tap.

282
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.320
So we'll go ahead and single finger double tap here.

283
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.920
<v Narrator>Favorites, heading.</v>

284
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Douglas>Okay, so our New Folder interface closed,</v>

285
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.940
and we have been placed right on our heading,

286
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.180
of course back in the top of our Bookmarks

287
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.460
interface screen here.

288
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.610
And our Hadley folder has been added

289
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.930
to our folders list here.

290
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.830
Now we still need to activate our done button

291
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.910
in the bottom-right corner of our Bookmarks interface,

292
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.490
because we're still in edit more here.

293
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.090
So we'll just touch in the bottom-right hand corner

294
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.320
of our screen here, and there's a Done button here.

295
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.346
<v Narrator>Done button.</v>

296
00:13:12.346 --> 00:13:14.360
<v Douglas>And there it is.</v>

297
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.740
So now all we need to is just single finger double tap.

298
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.593
So we'll do that.

299
00:13:17.593 --> 00:13:20.010
I'll single finger double tap here.

300
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.193
<v Narrator>Done, Edit button.</v>

301
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.660
<v Douglas>And we heard our Done button</v>

302
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.140
in the bottom-right corner turn back into an Edit button.

303
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.973
Okay.

304
00:13:28.973 --> 00:13:31.410
So how about we check out this bookmarks list

305
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.280
and find our new Hadley folder here?

306
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.720
Now we'll orient ourself back to our Bookmarks interface

307
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.640
by just touching our Favorites heading again.

308
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.203
So we'll just touch our heading here.

309
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.220
<v Narrator>Favorites, heading.</v>

310
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Douglas>Okay, so how about we go ahead then</v>

311
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.900
and just right flick to our new Hadley folder?

312
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.830
And so we'll just right flick here.

313
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.830
Go ahead and right flick.

314
00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.730
<v Narrator>Done button.</v>

315
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.070
<v Douglas>Of course there's our Done button</v>

316
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.490
when we finish with this page

317
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.410
there in the top right-hand corner there.

318
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.710
So we'll right flick again.

319
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Narrator>Selected, Bookmarks button, one of three.</v>

320
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.460
<v Douglas>Buttons across the top.</v>

321
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.570
There's our bookmarks.

322
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.450
<v Narrator>Reading List button, two of three.</v>

323
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.330
<v Douglas>Right flick to our Reading List button here.</v>

324
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.250
We'll right flick again.

325
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.390
<v Narrator>Social Links button, three of three.</v>

326
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.223
<v Douglas>There's three of three.</v>

327
00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:19.610
We'll right flick one more time.

328
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.690
<v Narrator>Hadley folder button, actions available.</v>

329
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.750
<v Douglas>There is our Hadley folder,</v>

330
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.040
and it's now the first folder in our list here.

331
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.510
So that's pretty great.

332
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.670
Now we heard voiceover announce

333
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.280
that we actually have actions available to us here.

334
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.640
So we know when we hear actions

335
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.760
that we can just flick up and down our screen

336
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.320
to hear these different actions.

337
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.440
So how about we do that?

338
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.620
We will just flick down.

339
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.940
So we'll just flick down.

340
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Narrator>Delete.</v>

341
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Douglas>Okay, and we heard voiceover announce delete.</v>

342
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.600
And this is great because

343
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.730
this gives us a really quick way

344
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.470
to delete any unwanted folders here.

345
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.700
However, we don't wanna delete our Hadley folder here,

346
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.290
so we'll just flick down again

347
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.010
to hear our other action here.

348
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.570
So we'll just flick down again.

349
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.720
<v Narrator>Activate item, default action.</v>

350
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.120
<v Douglas>And voiceover announced activate item here</v>

351
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.330
and that this is our default action.

352
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.570
So, we know now that if we were to single finger double tap

353
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.140
all of the websites that we've saved in our Hadley folder

354
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.270
would be visible.

355
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:35.330
Now we don't currently have any saved websites here,

356
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.980
and activating our Hadley folder

357
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.160
would just give us an empty list.

358
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.690
So how about we go ahead and add a website

359
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.930
to our new Hadley folder.

360
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.120
Remember, we're gonna add our

361
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.050
iFocus Instructional Videos website to this.

362
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.450
So let's go ahead and close our Bookmarks interface here,

363
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.570
and remember to do this.

364
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.000
We'll just need to activate that Done button

365
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.140
at the top-right corner of our screen here.

366
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.710
So, we'll just touch our done button here,

367
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.474
and we'll touch.

368
00:16:05.474 --> 00:16:07.500
<v Narrator>Done button.</v>

369
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.610
<v Douglas>And we'll just need to</v>

370
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.920
single finger double tap here.

371
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.070
So we'll go ahead single finger double tap.

372
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.990
<v Narrator>Skip to content in page link.</v>

373
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.830
<v Douglas>Okay, so our Bookmarks interface has closed,</v>

374
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.780
and we have been placed right back in our

375
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.650
iFocus Instructional Videos website here.

376
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.390
Okay, now let's check out

377
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.930
how to add this website to our new Hadley folder.

378
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.350
So we'll just need to touch again in or toolbar

379
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.890
and let's go ahead and touch down here in the bottom left

380
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.720
corner down here to orient ourselves again.

381
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.590
So we'll just touch down here.

382
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Narrator>Back button.</v>

383
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.580
Double tap and hold to open History.

384
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Douglas>Okay, so here we are on our Back button again.</v>

385
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.500
And remember we only need to move to our Share button

386
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.298
to actually add this website as a bookmark.

387
00:16:56.298 --> 00:17:00.590
Let's just right flick until we get to our Share tool here.

388
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.690
So we'll just right flick.

389
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.450
<v Narrator>Forward button.</v>

390
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Douglas>Of course there's our Forward button again.</v>

391
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.910
So we'll right flick again.

392
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.610
<v Narrator>Share button.</v>

393
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.690
<v Douglas>Okay, and here we are on our Share button now</v>

394
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.090
in the bottom center of our screen.

395
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:15.860
So all we need to do is just single finger double tap

396
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.820
to open our Share options up here.

397
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.623
So we'll just single finger double tap anywhere.

398
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.280
<v Narrator>Airdrop recipient, no one found yet.</v>

399
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.460
Image.

400
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.370
When an Airdrop recipient is in range,

401
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.720
double tap on their icon here to start sharing.

402
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.413
<v Douglas>Okay, so our Share dialog box</v>

403
00:17:32.413 --> 00:17:35.090
is open at the bottom of our screen here,

404
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.150
and we've been given a lot of different ways

405
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.250
to share our website here.

406
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.760
Now we aren't going to go into detail

407
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.210
about all these Share options.

408
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.827
However, we'll quickly right flick

409
00:17:46.827 --> 00:17:49.720
and just briefly talk about each one of them.

410
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.840
And we'll do this as we look for our Add Bookmark button.

411
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.480
Okay, so let's go ahead and just right flick.

412
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.910
So we'll right flick here.

413
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.240
Now we're actually on our Share, our Airdrop button here.

414
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.710
Airdrop gives us the ability to share

415
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.260
any files with anybody round us

416
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.710
that also has an Apple device.

417
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.440
So that's a really cool feature to have.

418
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.270
So let's go ahead and just right flick from here.

419
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.856
Then we'll get a little descriptor here of this.

420
00:18:13.856 --> 00:18:16.750
<v Narrator>Airdrop, share instantly with people nearby.</v>

421
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.300
If they turn on Airdrop from Control Center on iOS

422
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.150
or from Finder on the Mac, you'll see their names here.

423
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.273
Just tap to share.

424
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.010
<v Douglas>Okay, they sort of told us what we just said,</v>

425
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.310
so we'll go ahead and right flick here.

426
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.498
<v Narrator>Message button, dragable.</v>

427
00:18:30.498 --> 00:18:31.900
<v ->Okay, so here's--</v>
<v ->Double tap and hold.</v>

428
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.300
Wait for the sound, then drag to rearrange.

429
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.680
<v Douglas>And we're gonna get these hints every time.</v>

430
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.830
So we can move these round

431
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.410
by dragging them around if we like.

432
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.770
However, this is our messages button,

433
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.290
so we can actually message this webpage

434
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.200
or send this webpage to somebody,

435
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.390
a text message here.

436
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.310
So we'll right flick.

437
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.330
<v Narrator>Mail button, dragable.</v>

438
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.980
<v ->And again--</v>
<v ->Double tap and hold,</v>

439
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.360
wait for the sound, then drag to rearrange

440
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.857
<v Douglas>And we can mail this webpage,</v>

441
00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:57.800
the link to this webpage, to a friend if we like.

442
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800
So we'll just right flick from here.

443
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.100
<v Narrator>Reminders button, dragable.</v>

444
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.760
<v Douglas>So, Reminders, we'll flick again.</v>

445
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.530
<v Narrator>Notes button, dragable.</v>

446
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.460
<v ->We can send this as a note.</v>
<v ->Double tap and hold.</v>

447
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.380
Wait for the sound.
<v ->We'll right flick.</v>

448
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.147
<v ->Save PDF to iBooks,</v>
<v ->Save it as a PDF.</v>

449
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:11.210
<v ->Dragable, Add to Favorites button, dragable.</v>

450
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.356
<v ->Add this to our Favorites.</v>
<v ->Add Bookmark button,</v>

451
00:19:13.356 --> 00:19:14.810
dragable.

452
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.230
Double tap and hold, wait for the sound,

453
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.700
then drag to rearrange.

454
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.910
<v Douglas>Okay, and we're gonna get those hints</v>

455
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.743
for everyone of those.

456
00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:25.743
So, anyway, we're already on our Add Bookmark button here.

457
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.820
And you probably already guessed.

458
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.710
All we need to do is single finger double tap

459
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.030
to start adding this

460
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:36.893
to our bookmarks here.

461
00:19:36.893 --> 00:19:40.010
So all we need to do is just single finger double tap.

462
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.860
So we'll go ahead and just single finger double tap here.

463
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Narrator>Selected text field is editing.</v>

464
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.920
Resources, instructional videos,

465
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.530
the Hadley School for the Blind.

466
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.570
Insertion point at end.

467
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.710
<v Douglas>Okay, so we have another dialog box,</v>

468
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.320
and this is our Add Bookmark Interface here.

469
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.120
Now, we've actually been placed in an edit field

470
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.100
where we can name our website.

471
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.040
However, our website is typically already named for us

472
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.260
in our edit field, and we'll check it out in just a bit.

473
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.870
But how about we quickly just flick through

474
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.920
our Add Bookmark interface here

475
00:20:17.077 --> 00:20:20.630
to check out how it all works and what we have here?

476
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.650
And we'll begin by just orienting ourself

477
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.090
to the top of our screen here.

478
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.700
So we'll go ahead and just touch on the top-left

479
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.930
corner of our screen,

480
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.683
and I will just touch here.

481
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.010
<v Narrator>Cancel button.</v>

482
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.660
<v Douglas>Alright, so here's our Cancel button,</v>

483
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.120
and of course it's in the top-left corner.

484
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.840
And maybe if we decided that

485
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.750
we didn't wanna add this website after all,

486
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.470
we can just single finger double tap

487
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.610
and we of course we'll be placed right back in our website.

488
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.910
However, we do want to add this one,

489
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.520
so we'll just right flick from here.

490
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.460
So we'll go ahead and right flick.

491
00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Narrator>Add Bookmark, heading.</v>

492
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.710
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's our Add Bookmark heading.</v>

493
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.940
Of course, headings are right in the

494
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.960
top center of our screen, just below our time.

495
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.033
And so we'll just right flick from here.

496
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.880
<v Narrator>Save button.</v>

497
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.350
<v Douglas>Okay, so here is our Save button,</v>

498
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.050
and of course we're gonna come back

499
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.480
and activate our Save button

500
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.560
once we have actually finished exploring

501
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.300
the rest of the screen here.

502
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.780
And so we'll go ahead and just right flick from here.

503
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.110
So we'll right flick.

504
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Narrator>Text field is editing, character mode,</v>

505
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.630
resources, instructional videos,

506
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.230
the Hadley School for the Blind,

507
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.563
insertion point at end.

508
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.120
<v Douglas>Okay, and here we are</v>

509
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.273
back in our edit field for naming our website.

510
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.980
You know, and I like the name of this.

511
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.990
It looks okay to me,

512
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.720
but I could change it if we wanted to change this.

513
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.410
We could change it to anything,

514
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.780
but we're gonna go ahead and just right flick

515
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.060
and leave this as it is.

516
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.890
So we'll right flick from here.

517
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Narrator>Clear Text button.</v>

518
00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.370
<v Douglas>And here's our Clear Text button</v>

519
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.770
just to the right of our edit field here.

520
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.850
And we could just single finger double tap here

521
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.510
if we wanted to quickly clear our edit field here

522
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.433
for renaming our text.

523
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.950
However, we don't wanna do that,

524
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.340
so we will just go ahead and right flick from here.

525
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.500
So we'll right flick.

526
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.450
<v Narrator>Cap R.</v>

527
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.040
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's the icon</v>

528
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.260
that's actually gonna appear

529
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.060
before the website name in our list.

530
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.330
And it's typically the first letter

531
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.030
of our website name here, and this is resources.

532
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.450
So let's just go ahead and right flick from here.

533
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.114
So we'll right flick.

534
00:22:33.114 --> 00:22:37.110
<v Narrator>Http//hadley.edu/instructionalvideos.asp.</v>

535
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.630
Dimmed text field.

536
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.310
<v Douglas>Great, this is our URL,</v>

537
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.370
our website name here.

538
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.470
And we don't wanna change this,

539
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.469
because if we start modifying this,

540
00:22:47.469 --> 00:22:49.900
it's not gonna go back to this website.

541
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.860
So we'll go ahead and just right flick from here,

542
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:52.940
and we'll right flick.

543
00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.230
<v Narrator>Location, heading.</v>

544
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.030
<v Douglas>Okay, so here's our heading for our location.</v>

545
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.990
And the location refers to the folder

546
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.640
in which we wanna save our website.

547
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.470
And this is important because

548
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.000
of course this is our Hadley folder

549
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.300
where we're wanting to save this.

550
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.900
So we'll just right flick from here.

551
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.733
We'll right flick.

552
00:23:13.733 --> 00:23:14.750
<v Narrator>Favorites.</v>

553
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.760
<v Douglas>Okay, so here we are</v>

554
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.810
on what actually is a button,

555
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.670
and this is the name of the folder

556
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.760
in which we want to save our websites.

557
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.160
However, we don't wanna save our website

558
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.810
to our favorites folder.

559
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.140
So, if we single finger double tap,

560
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.480
we'll actually bring up a list of all of our folder here,

561
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.190
and we'll be able to choose

562
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.820
our Hadley folder from this list.

563
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.170
So let's go ahead and just single finger double tap here.

564
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.870
So we'll single finger double tap.

565
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Narrator>Selected, Favorites.</v>

566
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.773
<v Douglas>Okay.</v>

567
00:23:49.773 --> 00:23:51.770
Now this is great.

568
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.990
A list has opened here below our Locations heading,

569
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.213
and we are back in our Add Bookmark interface here.

570
00:24:00.631 --> 00:24:02.450
Then we've been placed on our Favorites folder here.

571
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.570
So we can now just start right flicking

572
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.730
until we find our Hadley folder in our folder list here.

573
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.360
So let's go ahead and just right flick,

574
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.690
and we'll right flick.

575
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Narrator>Hadley.</v>

576
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Douglas>Okay, that didn't take long.</v>

577
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.373
That was easy.

578
00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:20.120
It's at the very top of our list.

579
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.180
And now our focus is right on our Hadley folder.

580
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.540
So all we need to now

581
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.570
is just single finger double tap to select it.

582
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.110
So we'll do just that.

583
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.540
We will single finger double tap.

584
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.660
<v Narrator>Selected, Hadley, resources,</v>

585
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.650
instructional videos, the Hadley School for the Blind,

586
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.483
text field.

587
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.970
<v Douglas>Okay, so we have now selected our Hadley folder,</v>

588
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.390
as our website's location.

589
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.890
So, to finish, saving our instructional video website

590
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.590
in our Hadley's folder,

591
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.560
we just need to activate our save button

592
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.750
in the top-right hand corner of our screen.

593
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.023
So we'll just touch our save button here.

594
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.320
<v Narrator>78%, Save button.</v>

595
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.590
<v Douglas>Okay, so there's our Save button.</v>

596
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.000
So now all we need to do is just single finger double tap,

597
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.980
and I will do that.

598
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.880
We'll single finger double tap.

599
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.310
<v Narrator>Save.</v>

600
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.103
Skipped to content in page link.

601
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:15.850
<v Douglas>Great.</v>

602
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.720
We have been placed

603
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.320
right back in our instructional videos webpage here.

604
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.090
And it's been saved right in our Hadley folder

605
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.380
in our bookmarks.

606
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.213
Alright.

607
00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:29.730
So how about we make sure it's there?

608
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.930
So we'll just go ahead

609
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.950
and touch in the bottom-left hand corner of our screen

610
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.350
to orient ourself to our toolbar here.

611
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.113
So we'll go ahead and just touch.

612
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.870
<v Narrator>Back button.</v>

613
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.000
Double tap and hold to open history.

614
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.800
<v Douglas>Of course there's our Back button again.</v>

615
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.630
So we'll just need to right flick

616
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.130
until we get to our Show Bookmarks button.

617
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.730
So we'll just right flick.

618
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.310
<v Narrator>Forward button.</v>

619
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.610
<v Douglas>Of course there's our Forward button.</v>

620
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.480
We'll right flick again.

621
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Narrator>Share button.</v>

622
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.530
<v Douglas>And there's our Share button,</v>

623
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.080
so we'll just right click one more time.

624
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Narrator>Show Bookmarks button.</v>

625
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.750
<v Douglas>Okay, so here we are</v>

626
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.160
on our Show Bookmarks button,

627
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.100
so we'll just single finger double tap

628
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.700
to open our bookmarks list again.

629
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.030
So we'll just single finger double tap.

630
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.990
<v Narrator>Favorites, Bookmarks, Back button.</v>

631
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.310
<v Douglas>Okay, and of course</v>

632
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.340
this should look very familiar,

633
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.490
because we're once again in the top-left corner

634
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.050
of our Favorite Bookmarks screen here.

635
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.880
So we'll go ahead and just right flick

636
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.680
until we find our Hadley folder here.

637
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.470
So we'll just right flick to Hadley.

638
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:30.790
<v Narrator>Favorites, heading.</v>

639
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.710
<v Douglas>There's our heading again.</v>

640
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.360
So we'll right flick.
<v ->Done button.</v>

641
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.400
<v Douglas>Of course there's our Done button</v>

642
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.390
in the top-right corner.

643
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.890
We'll have these three buttons across here.

644
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.687
<v Narrator>Selected Bookmarks button, one of three.</v>

645
00:26:39.687 --> 00:26:41.290
<v Douglas>That's our Bookmarks button.</v>

646
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.123
We'll right flick

647
00:26:42.123 --> 00:26:42.956
a couple more times.
<v ->Readings button,</v>

648
00:26:42.956 --> 00:26:44.000
two of three.

649
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.710
<v ->Right flick again.</v>
<v ->Social Links button,</v>

650
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.543
three of three.

651
00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:47.410
<v Douglas>And we right click again,</v>

652
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.510
we'll find our Hadley folder.

653
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.400
<v Narrator>Hadley folder button, actions available.</v>

654
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.488
<v Douglas>And here's our Hadley folder again.</v>

655
00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:58.440
Of course, all we need to do is single finger double tap,

656
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.380
and we should find our new

657
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.490
instructional video website right inside here.

658
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.440
So we'll just single finger double tap.

659
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Narrator>Favorites, Back button.</v>

660
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.750
<v Douglas>Okay, so our Hadley folder has opened,</v>

661
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.690
and we are presented with a list

662
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.370
of all the website that we've added to it.

663
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.560
However, we only have one here, right?

664
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.840
Now, we've been placed on a back button

665
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.970
in the top-left corner of our screen here.

666
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.040
And of course this will move as back

667
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.460
to that folders if we were to activate it.

668
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.800
So let's go ahead and just right flick

669
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.940
until we find our instructional videos website bookmark

670
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:38.960
in this folder.

671
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.810
So we'll just go ahead and just right flick from here.

672
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.460
<v Narrator>Hadley, heading.</v>

673
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.830
<v Douglas>There's our Hadley heading</v>

674
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.240
since we're in our Hadley folder,

675
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.710
at the top center of our screen.

676
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:48.633
So we'll just right flick again.

677
00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:49.900
<v Narrator>Done button.</v>

678
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.930
<v Douglas>There's our Done button.</v>

679
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.190
If we decided we didn't want to go to this after all,

680
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.260
we could just easily close this

681
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.080
by single finger double tapping there.

682
00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.100
So we'll just right flick.

683
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Narrator>Selected, Bookmarks button, one of three.</v>

684
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.410
<v Douglas>These three buttons are gonna be just the same</v>

685
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.060
as our Folders screen there, or interface there.

686
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.580
So we'll just right flick.

687
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.937
Reading List button, two of three.

688
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Douglas>So our Reading list button</v>

689
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.630
in the center of those.

690
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.540
<v Narrator>Social Links button, three of three.</v>

691
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.373
<v Douglas>There's our Social Links</v>

692
00:28:14.373 --> 00:28:15.206
just to the right of that.

693
00:28:15.206 --> 00:28:16.790
And we'll flick one more time.

694
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:21.180
We should find our instructional videos website.

695
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Narrator>Resources, instructional videos,</v>

696
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.913
the Hadley School for the Blind, actions available.

697
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Douglas>Super, and here's our</v>

698
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.793
instructional videos bookmark.

699
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.640
And of course we heard actions,

700
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.450
so we could easily flick through our actions

701
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.630
and delete it if we want.

702
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.823
We don't wanna do that.

703
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.000
Now, all we need to do,

704
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.440
since our focus is on this bookmark here

705
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.543
is of course just single finger double tap.

706
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.160
We've already have this website open,

707
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.590
but it would relaunch it here.

708
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.940
So we'll go ahead and single finger double tap.

709
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Narrator>Skip to content in page link.</v>

710
00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.723
<v Douglas>Okay.</v>

711
00:28:59.723 --> 00:29:01.380
Just like we said, our instructional video website

712
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.350
was already open.

713
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:07.350
However, it has reloaded for us and ready to begin,

714
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.190
checking out all of our great

715
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.590
iFocus instructional videos here.

716
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.493
Okay, so, how great is that?

717
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.560
You know, setting bookmarks really is a great way

718
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.860
to store all of our favorite websites.

719
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.670
And creating folders also gives us a great way

720
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.953
of getting even more organized.

721
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.390
And that's great.

722
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.740
Again, my name is Douglas Walker.

723
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.973
Take care and I'll see you next time.
