Gian: Hi, my name is Gian Wild and I'm the Director of AccessibilityOz.

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.200
We've been operating for two years and today I would like to introduce you

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.000
to the world's first accessible video player, OzPlayer.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.179
Web accessibility is about making websites and applications accessible to people with disabilities.

5
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.660
When it comes to online videos, this is about people with deafness, or people

6
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.910
who are blind or visually impaired, as well as people who have physical disabilities or

7
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.000
cognitive disabilities. So we developed OzPlayer to address the needs of all people with disabilities.

8
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.300
We've tested over 100 web sites in the last year and approximately eighty per cent of

9
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.200
those websites had a video player of some sort. Every single video player that we tested

10
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.430
was inaccessible in some form. Some contained keyboard traps, others couldn't be operated

11
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.240
via the keyboard, others allowed some operation via the keyboard but really important features

12
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.640
like captions and audio descriptions couldn't be activated via the keyboard. There are other

13
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.359
issues such as videos starting automatically and the lack of audio descriptions and captions.

14
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:29.130
So our clients kept asking us what video player they should use and we decided that we had

15
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.130
to build our own in order to meet this need.

16
00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:49.990
Some videos contain keyboard traps and this is a known bug of Flash features within Firefox.

17
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.909
When a video contains a keyboard trap, the user essentially needs to close the browser

18
00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.209
window entirely and start again therefore rendering the content completely inaccessible

19
00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.000
to the user.

20
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.370
When a video is inaccessible to the keyboard, then users with physical disabilities such

21
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.230
as Parkinson's disease can't access the video content. We found in a number of video players

22
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.890
that video controls such as play and pause could be activated via the keyboard, but other

23
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.220
controls such as volume or activating captions or audio descriptions could not be activated

24
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.000
by the keyboard rendering these players inaccessible.

25
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.730
When videos start automatically they can be extremely disorientating to the end user.

26
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.439
This is when a video starts as soon as you open the page and this can be specifically

27
00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.299
problematic to screen reader users. Screen reader users have a aural version of the page

28
00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.799
spoken aloud to them and as you can imagine, if a video starts playing as soon as you load

29
00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.689
a page then a screen reader user isn't going to be able to hear the contents of their screen

30
00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.500
reader and be able to navigate the page - even to the point of being able to turn off that

31
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.500
video. So starting automatically, which YouTube does, is a serious accessibility issue.

32
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.310
OzPlayer is fully keyboard accessible. You can turn captions on and off, you can move

33
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.909
the slider controls up and down, you can change the volume using the keyboard only. We also

34
00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.739
have a unique feature in skip links at the top of the video allowing users to skip straight

35
00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.099
to the transcript or skip the video entirely. We have native keyboard controls and one of

36
00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.829
the things that is unique within OzPlayer is the use of HTML5. We've used a variety

37
00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.049
of HTML5 features such as the VIDEO and AUDIO elements. There are a number of features that

38
00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.560
we haven't used such as the native Text Track API because it's not very well supported but

39
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.500
as the browsers change, we will of course be including these issues.

40
00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.130
Of course video content can be made inaccessible at the source. So containing flickering or

41
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.100
flashing content can trigger epilepsy and migraines in some people. In fact I've actually

42
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.360
had migraine triggered myself when watching some videos. There are other issues such as

43
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.300
colour contrast and the use of colour. But of course the most important issues are the

44
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.979
use of captions and audio descriptions. It is absolutely essential that any videos that

45
00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.470
are created are created with captions and with audio descriptions. A text transcript,

46
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.710
although not specifically required by WCAG2 is also an absolutely essential part of making

47
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.850
any video accessible.

48
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.069
We are really proud of OzPlayer but of course we are working to include new features in

49
00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.599
our next version. These features include interactive media elements, sign language support and

50
00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.599
extended audio descriptions.

51
00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.590
At AccessibilityOz we're continually iterating and we would love to improve our video player

52
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.990
for all users. So please let us know if there is anything you would like to see in the next

53
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.100
version of OzPlayer
