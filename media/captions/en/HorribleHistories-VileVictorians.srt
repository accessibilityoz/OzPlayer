00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,120
Well, gentlemen certainly. This is no place for a lady.

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,160
MEN SNIGGER.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,120
It gives me great pleasure, and no small amount of relief,

00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,480
to declare this, the first ever flushing public lavatory, open.

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,520
APPLAUSE.

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,320
WHISTLING.

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,840
Might want to leave it five minutes.

00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,440
HE GASPS. Oh, my goodness!

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,200
A year previously, in 1851,

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,800
temporary toilets were exhibited at the Great Exhibition in London's Hyde Park

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,920
and visitors were charged a penny to use them.

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
That is thought to be the origin of the phrase "to spend a penny".

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
And this is the origin of the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,400
Hm, interesting.

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,720
But that's not what's supposed to happen.

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,800
Darling, I don't want to worry you or anything,

00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,960
- but I think you might be dead. 
- Hm?

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,800
I don't think so, darling.

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,720
This newspaper seems to think you are, and it's always been very reliable in the past.

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,800
“Doctor Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite,

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,000
“died yesterday in the French resort of Cannes.”

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
Let me see that.

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,480
Good grief, it does say I'm dead.

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,280
Look what they're calling me, “the merchant of death”.

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,800
It says here, “Dr Alfred Nobel became rich

00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,120
“by finding ways to kill more people even faster than ever before.”

00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,200
You'd think that just because I'd invented dynamite,

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
I am personally responsible for the death of thousands of people!

00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,120
I mean honestly, have you ever heard such nonsense? 
CLOCK TICKS.

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,960
I said, have you ever heard such rubbish?

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,400
Sophie, if you have something to say...

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Well, you did invent what is, at this point in time,

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
the most powerful explosive on earth.

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,480
- And it has gone on to kill thousands of people. 
- What's your point?

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,000
All I'm saying is, you have to accept when people hear the word "Nobel",

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,880
they're always going to think of dynamite.

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,920
I knew I should've called it Nobel's Safety Powder.

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,280
Do you really think that when I actually do go that this is how I'll be remembered?

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,200
Oh, sweetheart, of course it is, my furry-cheeked little death merchant.

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,600
Well, not if I can help it!

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,480
I shall reinvent my own image.

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,200
- What? 
- I shall use my massive fortune to establish a special prize.

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,080
One that rewards positive human endeavours in the pursuit of peace

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,520
so that when I do die, I won't just be linked to explosives!

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,280
And I, Alfred Nobel, will call this special peace prize...

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,600
Prize-A-Mite!

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,000
Darling, why don't you call it the Nobel Peace Prize?

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,040
HE CHUCKLES.

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
I love you, darling, but you have absolutely no idea when it comes to marketing.

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,000
- A-hem! Tea! 
- Certainly.
