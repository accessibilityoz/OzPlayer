00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.320
<v Dignitary>Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Dignitary>Well, gentlemen certainly. This is no place for a lady.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.160
MEN SNIGGER.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Dignitary>It gives me great pleasure, and no small amount of relief,

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Dignitary>to declare this, the first ever flushing public lavatory, open.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.520
APPLAUSE.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Man>WHISTLING.

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Man>Might want to leave it five minutes.

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Dignitary>HE GASPS. Oh, my goodness!

10
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Rattus>A year previously, in 1851,

11
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Rattus>temporary toilets were exhibited at the Great Exhibition in London's Hyde Park

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Rattus>and visitors were charged a penny to use them.

13
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Rattus>That is thought to be the origin of the phrase "to spend a penny".

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Rattus>And this is the origin of the Nobel Peace Prize.

15
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Alfred Nobel>Hm, interesting.

16
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Alfred Nobel>But that's not what's supposed to happen.

17
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Sophie>Darling, I don't want to worry you or anything,

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Sophie>- but I think you might be dead.
<v Alfred Nobel>- Hm?

19
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Alfred Nobel>I don't think so, darling.

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Sophie>This newspaper seems to think you are, and it's always been very reliable in the past.

21
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Sophie>“Doctor Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite,

22
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Sophie>“died yesterday in the French resort of Cannes.”

23
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Alfred Nobel>Let me see that.

24
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Alfred Nobel>Good grief, it does say I'm dead.

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Alfred Nobel>Look what they're calling me, “the merchant of death”.

26
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Alfred Nobel>It says here, “Dr Alfred Nobel became rich

27
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Alfred Nobel>“by finding ways to kill more people even faster than ever before.”

28
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Alfred Nobel>You'd think that just because I'd invented dynamite,

29
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.800
<v Alfred Nobel>I am personally responsible for the death of thousands of people!

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Alfred Nobel>I mean honestly, have you ever heard such nonsense?
CLOCK TICKS.

31
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Alfred Nobel>I said, have you ever heard such rubbish?

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Alfred Nobel>Sophie, if you have something to say...

33
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Sophie>Well, you did invent what is, at this point in time,

34
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Sophie>the most powerful explosive on earth.

35
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Sophie>- And it has gone on to kill thousands of people.
<v Alfred Nobel>- What's your point?

36
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Sophie>All I'm saying is, you have to accept when people hear the word "Nobel",

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Sophie>they're always going to think of dynamite.

38
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Alfred Nobel>I knew I should've called it Nobel's Safety Powder.

39
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Alfred Nobel>Do you really think that when I actually do go that this is how I'll be remembered?

40
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Sophie>Oh, sweetheart, of course it is, my furry-cheeked little death merchant.

41
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600
<v Alfred Nobel>Well, not if I can help it!

42
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Alfred Nobel>I shall reinvent my own image.

43
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Sophie>- What?
<v Alfred Nobel>- I shall use my massive fortune to establish a special prize.

44
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Alfred Nobel>One that rewards positive human endeavours in the pursuit of peace

45
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Alfred Nobel>so that when I do die, I won't just be linked to explosives!

46
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.280
<v Alfred Nobel>And I, Alfred Nobel, will call this special peace prize...

47
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.600
<v Alfred Nobel>Prize-A-Mite!

48
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Sophie>Darling, why don't you call it the Nobel Peace Prize?

49
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.040
HE CHUCKLES.

50
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.440
<v Alfred Nobel>I love you, darling, but you have absolutely no idea when it comes to marketing.

51
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Alfred Nobel>- A-hem! Tea!
<v Sophie>- Certainly.
