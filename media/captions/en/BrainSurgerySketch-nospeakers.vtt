CUE-1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.301
Oh, Lionel. Glad you could make it.
Can I get you a drink?

CUE-2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.642
- Yeah something soft &#x2014; I'm driving.
- Okay.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:09.620
Parking's an absolute nightmare round here, isn't it?
Had to reverse into the tiniest of spaces.

CUE-4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.320
Still, I managed it. I mean, parking's not exactly <b><c.brain>brain surgery</c></b> is it?

NOTE
Just testing!

CUE 5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.340
<v>LAUGHS POLITELY

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.460
And I should know.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.340
Why's that, are you a doctor?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.970
Careful. Not a doctor. I'm a <b>brain surgeon</b>.

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.160
Big difference. <b>Big</b> difference!

CUE-10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.973
Yeah, I actually know a joke about this:

CUE-11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.150
“What's the difference between a doctor and a brain surgeon?

CUE-12
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.370
“One's, not exactly <c.brain>brain surgery</c>, the other, <b>is <c.brain>brain surgery</c></b>”

CUE-13
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.370
SIGHS WITH SMUG SATISFACTION

CUE-14
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.360
- So er, what do you guys do?
- I'm an accountant
- <i>(patronising tone)</i> Oh that's good. Yeah.

CUE-16
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.720
I could do with an accountant. Filling in those tax forms can get really confusing, can't it?

CUE-17
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.800
Still...

CUE-18
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.500
It's not exactly <c.brain>brain surgery</c> is it?

CUE-19
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.340
I mean, <c.brain>brain surgery</c>, believe me, is very <b>complex</b>

CUE-20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.150
- Are you an accountant too?
- Er no, I work for a charity.


00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.130
Oh, that's a very selfless job isn't it?


CUE-22
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.800
I really admire you, I don't think I could ever do what you do.

CUE-23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.340
I say that because it's emotionally draining not because it's <b>hard</b>.

CUE-24
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.220
I mean...

CUE-25
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.880
<i>(with a grimace)</i> It's not exactly <b><c.brain>brain surgery</c></b> is it?

CUE-26
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.890
Which, as a brain surgeon, is what I do.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.500
Lionel, here's your drink.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800
Lionel's a brain surgeon you know?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.700
<i>(slightly weary tone)</i> Yeah, he mentioned it.

CUE-30
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.570
Oh, Jeff. They keep you late at the space center?

CUE-31
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.000
<i>(resigned tone)</i> As always, yeah.

CUE-32
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.760
- (to herself) I'll take this food round.
- Have you met Lionel?
- Er, no. Hello Lionel.
- So Jeff, how do you earn a crust?

CUE-36
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.090
Well I'm a scientist. I work mainly with rockets.

CUE-37
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.300
It's, erm, pretty tough work.

CUE-38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.330
What do you do?

CUE-39
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.200
Well, I don't mean to boast, but er, I'm a brain surgeon.

CUE-40
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800
Brain surgery?

CUE-41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.210
Not exactly <b><c.rocket>rocket science</c></b>, is it?
