00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,680
I want to put that on ma heid. 

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,800
Know what I want to do? I want to put that on ma heid. 

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,200
Don't ask me why. 

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,320
Done! 

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,760

00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,720
You're watching Adventure Call. 

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,840
My name is Falconhoof and I will be your guide on your quest. 

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
Greetings, line two. What is your name, traveller? 

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,120
Hi, Falconhoof, my name's Ewan! 

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,640
Greetings, Ewan. Are you ready to begin your quest? 

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,600
'Just a moment. Shhh.' 

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,840
- EWAN GLUGS 
- 'Ah!' 

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,080
What was that you were drinking? It seems very delicious. 

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,840
'It is! It's Barry's Red Cola!' 

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,480
Ah! Barry's Red Cola. Sparkling, tasty and refreshing. 

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,200
A great companion on any adventure. Are you ready to begin yours? 

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,560
- 'I am now!' 
- Very well. 

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,760
You awake in a giant's kitchen. You're on a plate. 

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,720
Nearby is a steel goblet. 

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,920
You hear thunderous footsteps approaching. 

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,200
What would you like to do? 

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
'Hide in the goblet!' 

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
You climb over the lip of the goblet 

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
and dive into a pool of... 

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Barry's Red Cola! 

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,000
'Oh, really?' 

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,240
- Yes, really. 
- 'Man, I love that stuff.' 

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,600
Me, too. 

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,360
The giant searches the room for you. He glances towards the goblet. 

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,800
What would you like to do? 

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,320
'Drink Barry's Red Cola!' 

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,280
You drink the delicious Barry's Red Cola. 

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
The goblet is empty. 

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,080
You sit at the bottom of the goblet, safely out of view. 

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,560
Good idea, traveller. 

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,600
'I have a confession, Falconhoof. 

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,520
'It was luck! I just couldn't help drinking all that Barry's Red Cola!' 

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Ha-ha-ha. I hear you! 

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
Unfortunately, the giant also loves Barry's Red Cola 

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,040
and begins refilling the goblet from his bottle. 

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
What would you like to do? 

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,920
'Drink Barry's Red Cola!' 

44
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,680
You drink the Barry's Red Cola as it pours over you. 

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Barry's Red Cola also tastes great straight from the bottle. 

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,840
You remain out of view at the bottom of the goblet. 

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Another great idea, traveller. 

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
But don't tell me it was luck. 

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you just couldn't help drinking all that... 

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,840
- BOTH: 
- Barry's Red Cola! 

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,480
'Hey, you can't blame me, huh?' 

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,800
No way, man! But the giant keeps pouring faster than you can drink! 

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,240
You must act quickly. 

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,040
'Let me think about it.' 

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
HEARTY GLUGGING 

56
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
'Ah!' 

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
- Traveller? 
- 'Yeah?' 

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,160
- You're dead! 
- 'Oh, no! What happened?' 

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,640
You drowned in Barry's Red Cola. 

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,720
What a glorious way to die. 

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,600
'Yeah. I was too busy enjoying the real thing.' 

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,680
Ah, yes. What better way to enjoy red cola, 

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,000
than the real thing, the REAL red cola, Barry's Red Cola. 

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,160
CALLER HANGS UP 

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,200

Oh, hold on. I put it on for a laugh, but it's good - you should try it! 

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,480
Oh, how you doing? 

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,600
I was thinking of getting one of these. 

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,440
- I was thinking maybe that one? 
- HESITANTLY: 
- Mmm, yeah, yeah... 

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,480
Pretty standard, but... But, yeah, why not? 

77
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,520
I might not even need that, you know? 

78
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,320
I was thinking maybe, even just that? 

79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,160
That's... That one, It's, it's pretty basic. 

80

Entry level. I mean, what... I wouldn't. Hsss... 

81
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,880

HE EXHALES SHARPLY 

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Serious bit of kit here. This is actually what I've got in the hoose. 

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,000
But I'm no' sure if I need all that, though, you know? 

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,200
I might be fine with that. 

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,320
That's... Basic, entry-level, that. Wouldnae get that. 

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,080
You're thinking maybe more that? 

88
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,160
- HE SQUEAKS: 
- Hmmm, yeah, it's pretty standard, but... 

89

No' annoying at all, eh? How about if I play this?

And I look like this. 

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,880
This is pretty annoying, in't it? 

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
The hat, the top, the whole thing. 

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,840
Aye, this is pretty annoying. 

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,680
How about if I start doing this? 

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,560
And this? 

106
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
And occasionally do this? 

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
And just to top it off, I do this.

Hello, is this the number to phone if I've been affected

HE EXHALES DRAMATICALLY 

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,280
HE HISSES 

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,320
HE EXHALES DRAMATICALLY 

152
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,720
Miaow! 

153

Hello, my name's Raymond Day, and welcome to Paraside. 

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,040
Let's see where the spirit takes us. 

157
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,320
Could someone understand, please? 

158
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,040
I have here in spirit someone who, at the time of their passing, 

159
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,440
looked very different from how they usually looked, 

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
and not necessarily for the better. 

161
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,440
You, my dear? 

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,400
I think it might be my son. 

163
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
It might be your son. OK. 

164
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,200
And am I right in saying that this change in his appearance 

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
was caused by...an illness? 

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,680
Or an accident? Or...? 

167
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,200
Yeah, an accident. He was killed in a car crash. 

168
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
A crash? Oh, God! 

169
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,520
And you saw what had happened when you went to identify him. 

170
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,360
Am I right? 

171
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Well, I was in the car with him, 

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,840
but I had my seat belt on, so I survived but he didn't. 

173
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,480
Oh, lucky you! 

174
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,040
No, no, you weren't lucky, because you saw your son and he was, 

175
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,520
and he admits this himself, not a pretty picture.

177
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,720
His face was all over the place. Is that right? 

178
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,440
Good, because he's telling me now, who's this?

My husband.

This is Husband. 

181
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,920
You told Husband you couldn't get that face out of your mind. 

182
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,400
Every time you closed your eyes, it was there. 

183
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,240
It's just not how you want to remember your son. 

184
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,160
But he's telling me now, 

185

189
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,000

He's a mess. He's no different. He was trying to cheer you up, 

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,640

All right? 

344
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
I'm no' angry. 

345
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm disappointed, but I'm not angry. So here's what I'm going to do. 

346
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,040
I'm going to turn around, I'm going to shut my eyes, 

347
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,800
and I want whoever took the plate to put it back 

348
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,960
and I'm willing to draw a line under it, right there. 

349
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,800
OK? OK. 

350
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,800
Oh, thank God. Thanks for coming over. 

351
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,720
What's this all about? You didn't make any sense on the phone. 

352
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,120
- He's goin' about with one of them on his heid. 
- Ha-ha! What for? 

353
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120

354
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,040

SALESMAN SUCKS HIS TEETH 

368
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,600

369
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,440
SALESMAN EXHALES DRAMATICALLY 

370
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,160
HE HISSES, MEWS AND EXHALES REPEATEDLY 

371
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,520
Miaow! 

372
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,120
OK. Let's introduce ourselves. I'm Neil. 

373
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,200
- My name's Darren. 
- Hello, I'm Julie. 

374
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
Ma name's Jacqueline McCafferty. I lost... 

375
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,360
We'll just go through the names first, Jacqueline. 

376
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,800
'I was on that stupid group therapy...' 

377
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,600
- I'm Kerry. 
- I'm Nadine. 
- I'm Vince. 

378
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,920
So, Jacqueline, do you want to share? 

379
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,880
I lost three year of my life tae hero-ine. 

380
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,560
Another five tae a methadone programme meant to get us off it 

381
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,120
but that's me clean now! 

382
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,720
I haven't thought once about going back on the smack, until Tuesday. 

383
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,360
Washing machine broke. Neighbour says, "You flooded us! 

384
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,840
"Third time this month!" I was like, "It's the second!" 

385
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,480
Third? Second? Third? Second? Stressed oot the eyeballs! 

386
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,880
Felt like daein' a charge of kit into my arm there and then! 

387
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,760
So here I am. 

388
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,680
I know how you feel. 

389
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,160
I lost four year of my life to heroin, and four on methadone. 

390
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,240
That's me been out of work for about six month now. 

391
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,520
- The pressure... 
- Eight year all-in? 

392
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,120
You lost like, four year on the hero-ine, 

393
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,360
- and four year on the methadone? Eight year? 
- Aye. 

394
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,840
Well, same here! I'm five and three, you're nae worse than me! 

395
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,880
I know. We've all had it bad. 

396
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,320
- Aye, so... 
- So I've been unemployed for six months 

397
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,920
but there's still bills that need to get paid, and the pressure... 

398
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,240
Haud on! You were on the hero-ine for a year more than me 

399
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,400
but methadone a year less? 

400
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
I think so? 

401
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I lost five on methadone! You only lost four! Methadone's worse! 

402
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,640
- Aye, for some! 
- Methadone's worse! 

403
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,160
We agree, don't we? Methadone's worse than hero-ine, in't it?! 

404
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,680
- Well, no' for me! 
- Oh, no, not for you, not for Princess! 

405
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,120
Well, I thought a lot about heroin over the last couple of months, 

406
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,440
despite having lost everything to it. It's just the pressure. 

407
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,520
- Lost everything? 
- Pretty much. 

408
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,760
- Lose your daughter to the Social? 
- My sons? 

409
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,840
Well, getting two weans back is better than getting one! 

410
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,560
I've no' got them back! 

411
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,440
- Methadone's worse! 
- What?! 
- This isnae a competition, hen! 

412
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Can I get a shot? 

413
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,040
You've lost three year to heroin, right? Another five tae methadone? 

414
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:42,400
Well, I've lost three to heroin, but I only lost three to methadone.
